# How to Run

**Hosting the Frontend**\
In the root folder, open a command prompt and type 
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
Now the frontend should be hosted on `localhost:8000`\

**Hosting the Server**\
For the beckend, we use node.js. But first navigate to server.js in the server folder and change the username and password to that of your SQL databse server\

If you don't use a password, then comment out the password line.\
Then in the `server` folder, open a command prompt and type 
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will install all dependencies and start the server on `localhost:3000`\

**Hosting the Database**\
To host the databse locally, we recommend you use MySQL Workbench. In `server\db\sql\` folder, run the `create_db.sql` and `create_views.sql` scripts on your DBMS (MySQL Workbench in this case), then in the data `server\db\data\` folder you'd see the CSV files containing all sample data used for this project. Import the CSVs into the tables with matching names in the database\
\
Once all of this is done, the project should be up and running when you navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser
